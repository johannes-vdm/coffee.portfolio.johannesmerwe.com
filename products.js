    description: `Bean There is known for its pioneering work in direct fair trade African coffee. By partnering with farmers in 6 different coffee-producing countries, they've been able to source some incredibly high quality beans for all of us to enjoy, all while improving the quality of life of those who grow the crops.

    Historically, Bean There has been focused on single origins, and we've always offered their full selection of African beans for our customers to enjoy. We're excited to also be able to offer our customers this special blend, made up of the same delicious single origins we've all come to know and love!
    
    About Bean There Blend 44
    Bean There's Blend 44 combines their very popular Ethiopia Sidamo, and one of our favourites, their Burundi Kayanza. The marriage of these two wonderful coffees yields everything you might want in a bold yet balanced coffee, suitable for manual brewing or espresso. We particularly enjoyed it in plungers and moka pots.
    
    You'll find lots of berry flavours from strawberry to blueberries in the cup depending on your brew method, and occasionally we also found a subtle hint of orange coming through. This is only enhanced by a wonderful honey/caramel sweetness, with the little bit of tanginess creating a raw honey effect to our palates. Juicy and full-bodied, this blend is really a sensational every day drinking coffee that we'd highly recommend trying!`,
